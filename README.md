# mosaic_tool
Adapted from Daniel Schiffman's Obama Mosaic (https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code/tree/master/challenges/CC_49_ObamaMosaic) 

Uses Hamoids video exporting library in Processing (https://github.com/hamoid/video_export_processing)

This tool makes a mosaic from a source image. 
When the mouse is moved from left to right, the image tiles will scatter in 3D according to the image average brightness.

There are two ways to save your mosaic image.

1. Press the "s" key to take a screenshot of the current frame and save it to the tool folder. 

2. Press the "r" key to record a video as you move your mouse back and forth. When you are finished recording, press "q" and the program   will exit, saving the recording to the tool folder.
